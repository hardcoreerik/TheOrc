# Decision Log

## Rules

- Append decisions; do not rewrite old outcomes to look inevitable.
- Use one stable ID per decision.
- Record evidence, alternatives, consequences, owner, and review date.
- A proposed decision is not accepted until status changes to `accepted`.
- Superseding decisions link both directions.

## OE-ADR-001 — Begin as documentation and research

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Context:** A from-scratch engine is a large independent systems project with correctness, hardware, maintenance, and licensing risk.
- **Decision:** establish a reviewable document corpus and deterministic oracle plan before implementation.
- **Alternatives:** create a source scaffold immediately; fork llama.cpp; replace LLamaSharp directly.
- **Consequences:** no executable OrcEngine claim exists; implementation waits on Phase 0 approval.
- **Revisit trigger:** documentation review closes blocking contradictions and selects oracle/model.

## OE-ADR-002 — Coexist with current runtimes

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** OrcEngine starts as an experimental backend alongside `LLamaSharpRuntime`, `LlamaCppServerRuntime`, and `OllamaRuntime`; it does not replace or change defaults.
- **Evidence:** current runtimes are real and TheOrc depends on them; OrcEngine has no implementation.
- **Consequence:** integration is late, opt-in, and rollback is disabling selection.

## OE-ADR-003 — Define “from scratch” by execution ownership

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** OrcEngine owns model parsing, architecture semantics, tensor/cache execution, tokenization, and decoding. General compute/platform libraries may be used; complete inference engines may only serve as test oracles.
- **Consequence:** using BLAS/cuBLAS is permitted; wrapping llama.cpp/LLamaSharp as execution is not OrcEngine.

## OE-ADR-004 — Reference-oracle-first development

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** Phase 0 pins model, tokenizer, oracles, intermediate taps, tolerances, hashes, and fault injection before engine code.
- **Consequence:** plausible generated text cannot satisfy correctness gates.

## OE-ADR-005 — Tiny CPU-only float32 first engine

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** first engine supports one small classic Llama-style text model, float32 CPU, batch one, one sequence, fixed context, greedy decode.
- **Rejected for first phase:** CUDA, quantization, multiple architectures/sequences, adapters, grammar, HIVE.

## OE-ADR-006 — Eager fixed model loop before generic graph

- **Status:** proposed
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** directly invoke the minimum operators for the pinned architecture.
- **Alternative:** build graph IR/planner first.
- **Revisit trigger:** a measured backend, workspace, fusion, or scheduling requirement cannot be met clearly with eager execution.

## OE-ADR-007 — Strict compatibility tuple

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** never claim universal GGUF support; list exact format/architecture/tokenizer/dtype/backend/platform combinations.
- **Consequence:** unsupported inputs fail before execution with structured reasons.

## OE-ADR-008 — C ABI for eventual .NET integration

- **Status:** proposed
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** use opaque handles and plain C data structures with a SafeHandle-based managed wrapper.
- **Revisit trigger:** standalone engine proof reveals a simpler safe boundary or ownership mismatch.

## OE-ADR-009 — cuBLAS-first CUDA baseline

- **Status:** proposed
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** use cuBLAS/cuBLASLt experiment for dense operations before considering custom GEMM.
- **Revisit trigger:** Phase 6 profiling and layout/reproducibility results.

## OE-ADR-010 — OrcEngine is a separately authorized research track

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** current native-runtime documents describing LLamaSharp as the computation layer do not prohibit a separately scoped from-scratch OrcEngine experiment.
- **Consequence:** OrcEngine remains docs/research-only until its own gates pass and does not alter native-runtime production work.

## OE-ADR-011 — Product value may be prevention or measured improvement

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** continued work may be justified by a capability the existing stack prevents or by a material reproducible improvement on an agreed metric.
- **Consequence:** OrcEngine is not limited to novelty, but vague “does better” claims do not pass; baseline, workload, metric, hardware, and artifacts are required.

## OE-ADR-012 — Staged implementation-language stack

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** use Python with NumPy/PyTorch for Phase 0 oracles, C++20 for the standalone engine, CUDA C++/cuBLAS in the GPU phase, and a small C ABI plus C# `SafeHandle` wrapper only after standalone proof.
- **Alternative:** Rust core.
- **Revisit trigger:** measured safety, portability, build, or CUDA-integration evidence favors another core language before Phase 1 begins.

## OE-ADR-013 — Standards-compatible strict GGUF ingestion

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** implement a narrow official-GGUF subset with two-pass validation, bounded resources, typed manifest, precise compatibility verdicts, and fail-closed behavior. Do not create a proprietary model container for the initial path.
- **Consequence:** arrays may nest, tensor offsets are data-section-relative, and absent `general.alignment` means 32; these are parser-contract requirements, not converter folklore.

## OE-ADR-014 — First synthetic profile and real-model candidate

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-18
- **Decision:** `OE-L0-SYNTH-1` is the exact synthetic profile. `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M` revision `93efa2f097d58c2a74874c7e644dbc9b0cee75a2` is the first real-model candidate.
- **Consequence:** candidate status does not imply supported execution. Conversion, hashes, tokenizer reconciliation, licensing, and oracle reproduction remain Phase 0 gates.
